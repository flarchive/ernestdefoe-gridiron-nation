## Features

### 🎨 Design System
- **Crimson primary** (`#B22222`) — instantly recognisable college football colour
- **DM Sans Variable** — loaded from Google Fonts, replaces Flarum's default font throughout
- **14 px organic border-radius** — Avocado-inspired, applied to cards, dropdowns, modals, buttons, and inputs
- **Layered surface depth** — `#f0f1f5` page → `#fff` cards → `#f8f8fa` inset, mirrored in dark mode (`#0c0d10` → `#16171c` → `#0f1013`)
- **CSS custom property overrides** — works alongside any other Flarum 2 theme that respects `--primary-color`, `--body-bg`, etc.

### 🌙 Dark Mode
- Full `prefers-color-scheme: dark` support
- Surfaces shift from near-black `#0c0d10` through `#16171c` cards to `#0f1013` inset areas (inputs, poll options, comment bubbles)
- Primary colour shifts to `#e05c5c` for legibility on dark backgrounds
- Dark mode CSS block placed **last in the stylesheet** — correct cascade, no specificity fights

### 📺 Live Scores Widget
- Proxies ESPN's public college football scoreboard API — no API key required
- Displays up to 6 games sorted: **Live → Scheduled → Final**
- Pulsing green **LIVE** badge with quarter and clock detail
- Winning score highlighted in crimson
- Auto-refreshes every **60 seconds** while the page is open
- Graceful fallback — shows "Scores unavailable" if ESPN times out

### 🔥 Trending Widget
- Pulls the 5 most recently active discussions straight from Flarum's own API
- Rank numbers 1–2 shown in crimson, rest in muted grey

- Refreshes every **5 minutes**

### 👥 Online Now Widget

- Refreshes every **2 minutes**

### ⭐ Top Recruits Widget

- Per-recruit fields: **Name · Position · Height · Hometown · Stars (1–5) · Commit status · School · Sort order**
- Three commit states with colour-coded pills:
  - 🟢 **Committed** — school name shown
  - 🟡 **Undecided**
  - 🔴 **Decommitted**
- Crimson position badge (QB, WR, DT …)
- Amber star rating (★★★★☆)
- Refreshes every **10 minutes**

### 🛠 Admin Recruits Manager
